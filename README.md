1.Approaching software design involves breaking down the project into smaller tasks and defining what the software should achieve. Through my project work, I've honed skills in creating modular designs and considering user experience. I followed a structured design process, including requirements gathering, creating wireframes, and then translating them into actual designs using design tools. Tactics like user feedback and rapid prototyping helped refine the design, and these approaches can be valuable in future projects, ensuring user-centricity and iterative improvement.

2.When it comes to developing programs, I start by understanding the problem thoroughly and planning the architecture. In my 3D scene project, I embraced new development strategies like object-oriented programming and using libraries for complex tasks like rendering. Iteration was crucial as it allowed me to build on a strong foundation, gradually refining and adding features. My approach to development evolved by focusing on writing clean, maintainable code, which was essential to ensure the project's success and maintainability.

3.Computer science equips me with problem-solving skills applicable to various goals. Computational graphics and visualizations provide me with insights into data representation and interpretation. This knowledge will be valuable in my future educational pathway, allowing me to analyze complex concepts visually and enhance my learning. Professionally, these skills can translate into creating engaging presentations and reports, making data-driven decisions, and communicating complex ideas effectively.
